# Session 2: Theory


# A bundler is a tool which puts all your js code and dependencies and throws new javascript file 
# with merged and ready for the web 

# Incase of more files present in the project we need a config file 

# Different types of Bundlers : 
# Webpack
# Rollup
# Browserify 
# ESbuilld
# Parcel

# When we want something to be installed only on our developer machine 
# we use 
# npm install -D "your packagename"

# -D or --save dev  is a dev dependency 

# what is npm : 

# to run our app we need to depend on packages, npm will give module packages . 
# so we use npm  to install the dependencies.

# npm init -y :will ask what configuration need to be written in your package.json

# When you install first  pacakge, package.json will be updated, package-lock.json will be created 

# Tilde : will update you to all future patch versions without incrementing the major version
# ~1.2.3  :  < 1.3.0

# Caret: will update you to all minor/ future patch versions without incrementing the major versions 
# ~1.2.3 : < 2.0.0

# package-lock.json will create node_modules at server level ,so do not keep node_modules in git, 
# So add node_modules in .gitignore 


# type="module" in script tag tells borwser to import a module 
# It indicates the type of script represented 
# effects the loading behaviour of the site.
# Module scripts are not render blocking and execution is deferred (postponed) untill HTML is fully parsed

# parcel inserts defer attribute automatically to match in older brwsers and in development mode

# npx => execute through npm 

# Parcel : specifications

# Live server -> Hot module replacement  

# File watcher alogorithm -> C++ tracks of all files changing and tells server to reload 

# Production build :  npx parcel build index.html build to  host it in server
# Development build : npx parcel index.html build to  host it in server
# 							   index.html----------  is the entry point 

# Bundling (files can be seen in dist)
# minify 
# removing console.log /cleaning code 
# dev and production build 
# super fast build algorithm 
# Image optimization
# Caching while development
# compressing 
# compatible with older versions of browser 
# Https on dev => npx parcel index.html --https
# parcel manages port number 
# created a server and hosts at the same time , manages the port incase of multiple projects 
# "Anything which can be autogenerated on server can be placed in gitignore" 

# Consistent Hashing algorithm 
# zero config 

			
# Transitive dependencies 
# dependency tree :
# When we are using production  ready app,it will depende on other dependencies which will depend on other dependencies 

# Tree shaking 
# Lazy load 
# common dependencies between two dynamic imports will be split out and loaded in parallel with dynamically imported modules 
 
 
# npm and npx  : 
# npm install,update,delete js pacakges  
# npm is used to download packages from node package manager and npx is used to execute packages downloaded in this way 
# npm i "your package name"

# npx is pacakge executer 
# Running npx with the package name will search in node modules for that package and download the package if not present in node modules. 
# npx "your package name"
