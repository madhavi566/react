What is JSX :

Javascript expression is html like syntax but not html inside js 
JSX can return only one parent element at a time 
names in html is like class-name ,whereas in jsx is like className 

JSX uses react.createElement which makes developer experience better rather than writing length code 

type="module" in script tag tells borwser to import a module 
It indicates the type of script represented 
effects the loading behaviour of the site.
Module scripts are not render blocking and execution is deferred (postponed) untill HTML is fully parsed

asyn ,defer, cross-origin ,blocking 

{TitleComponent} : anything inside of {} behaves as js 
<Titlecomponent/>: self closing functional component rendering 
<Titlecomponent><Titlecomponent/>:  functional component rendering
